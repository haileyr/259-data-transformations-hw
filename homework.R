#PSYC 259 Homework 2 - Data Transformation
#For full credit, provide answers for at least 7/10 (10/10)

#List names of students collaborating with: 

### SETUP: RUN THIS BEFORE STARTING ----------

#Load packages
library(tidyverse)
ds <- read_csv("data_raw/rolling_stone_500.csv")

### Question 1 ---------- 

#Use glimpse to check the type of "Year". 
#Then, convert it to a numeric, saving it back to 'ds'
#Use typeof to check that your conversion succeeded

#ANSWER

glimpse(ds)

ds <- ds %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

typeof(ds$Year)

### Question 2 ---------- 

# Using a dplyr function,
# change ds so that all of the variables are lowercase

#ANSWER

ds <- ds %>% 
  rename_with(tolower)

colnames(ds)

### Question 3 ----------

# Use mutate to create a new variable in ds that has the decade of the year as a number
# For example, 1971 would become 1970, 2001 would become 2000
# Hint: read the documentation for ?floor

#ANSWER
?floor

ds <- ds %>% 
  mutate(decade = floor(year/10) * 10)

glimpse(ds)


### Question 4 ----------

# Sort the dataset by rank so that 1 is at the top

#ANSWER

ds <- ds %>% 
  arrange(rank)

glimpse(ds)

### Question 5 ----------

# Use filter and select to create a new tibble called 'top10'
# That just has the artists and songs for the top 10 songs

#ANSWER

top10 <- ds %>%
  filter(rank <= 10) %>%
  select(artist, song)

top10

### Question 6 ----------

# Use summarize to find the earliest, most recent, and average release year
# of all songs on the full list. Save it to a new tibble called "ds_sum"

#ANSWER

ds_sum <- ds %>% 
  summarize(
    earliest = min(year, na.rm = T),
    most_recent = max(year, na.rm = T), 
    average_release = mean(year, na.rm = T)
  )

ds_sum

### Question 7 ----------

# Use filter to find out the artists/song titles for the earliest, most 
# recent, and average-ist years in the data set (the values obtained in Q6). 
# Use one filter command only, and sort the responses by year

#ANSWER


ds %>% filter(
  year == min(year, na.rm = T) |
    year == max(year, na.rm = T) |
    year == round(mean(year, na.rm = T))
) %>%
  arrange(year)

# using ds_sum

ds %>% filter(
  year == ds_sum$earliest |
    year == ds_sum$most_recent |
    year == round (ds_sum$average_release)
) %>%
  arrange(year)


### Question 8 ---------- 

# There's an error here. The oldest song "Brass in Pocket"
# is from 1979! Use mutate and ifelse to fix the error, 
# recalculate decade, and then
# recalculate the responses from Questions 6-7 to
# find the correct oldest, averag-ist, and most recent songs

#ANSWER

ds <- ds %>% 
  mutate(
    year = ifelse(year == 1879, 1979, year),
    decade = floor(year/10) * 10
  )

unique(ds$year)

#Mcomment: The key filters the ifelse on song (like if there was more than song with 1879)
ds  <- ds %>% mutate(year = ifelse(song == "Brass in Pocket", 1979, year)

# recalculating #6  
ds_sum <- ds %>% 
  summarize(
    earliest = min(year, na.rm = T),
    most_recent = max(year, na.rm = T), 
    average_release = mean(year, na.rm = T)
  )

ds_sum  

# reclaculating #7

ds %>% filter(
  year == min(year, na.rm = T) |
    year == max(year, na.rm = T) |
    year == round(mean(year, na.rm = T))
) %>%
  arrange(year)

### Question 9 ---------

# Use group_by and summarize to find the average rank and 
# number of songs on the list by decade. To make things easier
# filter out the NA values from decade before summarizing
# You don't need to save the results anywhere
# Use the pipe %>% to string the commands together

#ANSWER

ds %>% 
  filter(!is.na(decade)) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarize(
    average_rank = mean(rank, na.rm = T), 
    number_of_songs = n()
  )

### Question 10 --------

# Look up the dplyr "count" function
# Use it to count up the number of songs by decade
# Then use slice_max() to pull the row with the most songs
# Use the pipe %>% to string the commands together

#ANSWER
?count

ds %>% 
  count(decade) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 1)
